## Getting Started

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/themastersdev/den.git`
2. Run `cd den`
3. Run `make den`
4. Start building!

⚠️**CAUTION**⚠️: Running `make den` removes any image and container named *den*, then builds a fresh image and container named *den*. Therefore, you should run `make code` to access the den after running steps 1 through 3.
